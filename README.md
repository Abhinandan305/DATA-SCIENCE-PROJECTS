HERE I HAVE PROVIDED THE REPORTS FOR ALL THE PROJECTS I HAVE DONE.

I HAVE ATTACHED THE CODE IN THE APPENDIX OF CERTAIN REPORTS FOR WHICH I COULDNT UPLOAD THE PYTHON FILE. APOLOGIES, BECAUSE MY LAPTOP WAS STOLEN SO I LOST OLD CODE FILES.

PROJECTS ARE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND NOSQL DATABASE INCLUDING ONE ON DATA QUALITY OR PROVENANCE.
